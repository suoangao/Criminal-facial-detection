# Criminal-facial-detection
We developed a criminal facial recognition system that can accurately detect whether a given forward-looking picture is a criminal or not. We first used an open source face extraction algorithm to extract faces from all images. Sequentially, this information was changed into an numpy array and fed into the Eigenface algorithm to generate the results.
